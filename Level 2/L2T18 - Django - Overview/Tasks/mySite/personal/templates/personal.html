        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>As a kid, I always liked puzzles and strategy games Starcraft, Command & Conquer and
            Age Of Empires. Then, I got introduced to programming via friends, and school and
            instantly liked the idea and enjoyed it. It feels like solving a puzzle to get the
            desired results or outcome. Finding the answer or fixing what is broken usually
            gives me more motivation. I would like to either be a software developer software
            engineer or even a game developer the things I would like to do the most and
            possibly live in Japan in the future, their food is awesome and the culture
            is interesting.</p>
