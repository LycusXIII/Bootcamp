An algorithm that asks the user to enter four numbers, sorts those
numbers from smallest to largest and then prints the sorted
numbers.

SET tempnumber to 0
SET number1 to 0
SET number2 to 0
SET number3 to 0
SET number4 to 0

PROMPT "Enter the first number"
SET user INPUT to number1
PROMPT "Enter the second number"
SET user INPUT to number2
PROMPT "Enter the third number"
SET user INPUT to number3
PROMPT "Enter the fourth number"
SET user INPUT to number4

REPEAT
	FOR i = 1 TO 3
		IF number(i) > number(i + 1)
			SET tempnumber to number(i)
			SET number(i) to number(i + 1)
			SET number(i + 1) = tempnumber
		ENDIF
	ENDFOR
ENDREPEAT

PRINT number1
PRINT number2
PRINT number3
PRINT number4
