○ A short bio: add a short (no more than three paragraphs) description
of yourself. Who are you? What is your experience? What are your
passions? What motivates you? What is it that you would most like to
do? Etc.
As a kid I always liked puzzels and stratagy games Starcraft, Command & Conquer and Age Of Empires.
Then got introduced to programing via friends, school and instantly liked the idea and enjoyed it
feels like solving a puzzel to get the desired results or outcome. Finding the answer or fixing
what is broken usual gives me more motivate. Would like to either be a software developer or software engineer or even a game developer would be the things i would like to do the most and possible live in
Japan in the future, thier food is awesome and the culture is interesting.
