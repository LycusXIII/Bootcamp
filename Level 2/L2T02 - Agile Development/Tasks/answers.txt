● How does the waterfall methodology differ from agile?
	- The waterfall method follows a sequential, phase-based
	  approach. Each phase needs to be completed before moving
	  on to the next. Where as agile is iterative and flexible,
	  the project progressess in short cycles and has continuous
	  feedback. Waterfall method offers a more structured plan
	  while Agile prioitizes flexibility and adaptaion.
	  
● Reread “Agile Manifesto”. Can you think of a situation in which one or
  more of the four “values” could get a software team into trouble?
	- Not having a clear project scope due to ever-changing requiremntes
	  can lead to feature creep or missed deadlines. With no clear endpoint
	  the development team can get stuck in an endless cycle of development
	  and feature changes.

● Describe the agile method in your own words.
	- Dividing the project into smaller managable pieces
	- After completing on piece the team can get feedback
	  form the customer on what is built so far.
	- With the feedback from the customer the team can
	  prioritize what piece to tackle next.
	- This method allows for adaptability that allows the team
      to tackle any changes to could occur mid project.

● Why do you think requirements change so much?
	- From external factors to the customers evovling needs
	  or technology limiations alot of factors could cause
	  the requirements of the system to change.

● Explain why first testing project features helps the programmer to develop
  a better understanding of the system requirements.
	- Testing first clarifies functionality to have a precise definitions
	  and creates an early feedback loop to catch errors early. This results
	  to a deeper understanding of the system.
